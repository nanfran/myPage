                <h2>Historically...</h2>
                <p>Coffee was introduced to Vietnam in the 1800s during the French colonial period. Given Vietnam's tropical climate and mountainous terrain, 
                    robusta coffee were the most predominant beans cultivated. And given how limited fresh milk was to come by in the country (even still to this day),
                    condensed milk was used instead as it had a long shelf life, cut down on the coffee's bitterness, and sweetened the drink. Since then the coffee 
                    industry in the country has boomed, with Vietnam being the largest producer of robusta coffee and second largest producer of coffee overall worldwide 
                    (second after Brazil).

                <h2>How It's Made...</h2>
                    <p>It's pretty simple to make a cup; it just takes a bit of time. Traditionally, viet coffee is prepared using a small metal filter called a <em>phin</em>. Ground coffee is placed at the bottom of the phin
                        and then hot water is poured over the grounds. With how fine the filter is, coffee slowly drips through the phin and into a glass,
                        the resulting coffee being strong and highly concentrated. From there sweetened condensed milk is added and mixed, where it can be enjoyed hot
                        just like that or ice can be added to make a refreshing iced drink!
                    </p>
